## Description
Meal Deals is a restaurant marketing application built with React & Semantic UI front-end and Ruby on Rails back-end. The idea is to incentives customers to return to particular dining locations through exclusive offers. Existing Yelp businesses can create an account and post an offer. Each offer has an "earn" month and a "redeem" month. During the "earn" month, if the customer visits an eligible restaurant, they are able to "check in" using their geo-location. This feature compares the customer's current location with the latitude and longitude coordinates from the restaurant found in Yelp's API. Therefore, the "check-in" feature will only work, if the customer is actually on site at the restaurant's location. Upon checking in, customers will receive a coupon to redeem. Coupons can have four statuses - "inactive", "redeemed", "upcoming", or "expired". "Inactive" coupons are "inactive" if they have not yet been redeemed and the current date falls within the "redeem" month. Only "inactive" coupons can be activated. Once activated, a coupon text with the current date will be sent to the customer's phone number (using Twilio), also, the coupon on the app will also flash colors with the current date. Either the text message or flashing coupon can be shown to the restaurant server so the offer may be redeemed. As a restaurant, the restaurant can log-in and view redemption data on all offers.

When neither a customer or restaurant is logged in. The user still has the capability to search for any cuisine by location and receive top results (using Yelp's API). Each restaurant result provide details, ratings, a link to Yelp and the ability to view location with Google Maps. In addition, all restaurants with an "earn" offer during the current month are viewable to all users. The user can see restaurant details, view all offers on google maps, but will need to sign in or create an account in order to earn coupons.

## Install
1. Clone down this repository on your local machine
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
